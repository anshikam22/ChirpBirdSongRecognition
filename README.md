# Chirp Bird Song Recognition
- This repository reflects my learnings  of my GDSC project Chirp Bird Song Recognition
- **AIM** : Birdsong recognition plays a crucial role in various fields, from ecological research to wildlife monitoring. The ’Chirp’ project aims to develop an efficient and accurate bird call recognition system using machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to enable the identification of bird species based on their unique vocalizations.
